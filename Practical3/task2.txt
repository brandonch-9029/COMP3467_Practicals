--- Installing and running the OSU micro-benchmarks ---

The OSU micro-benchmarks are a set of benchmarks for determining the performance of distributed and shared memory programming models, 
and in particular, for determining the bandwidth and latency of P2P and collective operations via MPI.
The source code is available at http://mvapich.cse.ohio-state.edu/benchmarks/.

a) Download and extract the tarball available at https://mvapich.cse.ohio-state.edu/download/mvapich/osu-micro-benchmarks-7.2.tar.gz on NCC.

b) Follow the instructions in the README file to build the benchmarks. 

c) Write an sbatch script that runs the osu_bw and osu_latency tests between two MPI ranks on the *same* node.

d) Write an sbatch script that runs the osu_bw and osu_latency tests between two MPI ranks on *different* nodes, 
   and compare it to the results of task c).
